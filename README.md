		<h1>JS HTML-powered my city</h1><br>
		<h2>About the project</h2><br>
		Hello there! My name is Gladyshev Anton and I'm an author of the project.<br>
		Homepage of the project is <a href="https://github.com/Areso/js-html-mycity">https://github.com/Areso/js-html-mycity</a><br>
		This pet-project is dedicated to create a playable game, written in vanilla JavaScript, 
		without using jQuery and modern whistlers and jugglers.<br>
		The project oriented to be compact (in terms of source code and resources), 
		blazing fast to download, fast enough to run even on aging devices with limited horsepower under the hood.<br>
		It runs well even on low-powered tablets and phones, let alone old PCs and laptops<br>
		It heavily uses JS technologies as HTML5.Canvas, EcmaScript5 localStorage, <span style="color:red">JSON.parse()</span>, and so on.

		<h2>About the game</h2>
		The game itself about building a city. You are starting with some amount of gold and a few citizens.<br>
		This is an IDLE game, which means, every minute your citizens will spawn new citizens and pay taxes to you.<br>
		You can constuct buildings, but upgrading existing ones will require each time more gold, because this game is an Incremental game.<br>
		As for now, constructing building do not requires time, only resources.<br> 
		Straight management, which means, you need place management by clicking here and there and you will get what you clicked.</br>
		<div style="color:red">You will explore wild territories near your city.</div><br>
		Regarding you choices, you could get boost in taxes or birthrate, happynness and so on.<br>
		Game could become to a Clicker game in case you build Gallows and like to execute you citizens.<br>
		This game created and new features right now in development inspiring by Travian, Townsmen, Stronghold and Stronghold Crusaders, HoMM (Heroes of Might and Magic), Lord of Realm, Anno series.<br> 
		You can export and import game to transfer your progress between different browsers and PCs.<br>
		For keeping you tuned, you will get handful of unfortunate or, on the contrary, fortunate events:<br>
		<ul> 
		 <li>thieves will steal your gold,</li>
		 <li><div style="color:red">aggressive neighbors will attack your city,</div></li>
		 <li><div style="color:red">flood and drought will kill your crops,</div></li>
		 <li><div style="color:red">mouses and rats will devastate your barns,</div></li>
		 <li>fires will destroy your buildings,</li>
		 <li>and I will add more events</li>
